About
=====

Named after the famous French artist and printmaker [Henri Matisse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Matisse), Matisse is a Python tool that will find your iTunes album artwork files, convert them from their unreadable format, and create a native Cover Flow viewing experience on your browser.

Matisse currently only runs on OS X and requires Python 2.0 or higher.

Usage
=====
To run, simply type at the Terminal:

`./Matisse.py`

And Matisse will find the latest downloaded versions of your iTunes album artwork, convert them to JPEG format in a folder on your Desktop, and load the artwork on your browser for your viewing pleasure.
