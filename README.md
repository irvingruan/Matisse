About
=====

Named after the famous French artist and printmaker [Henri Matisse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Matisse), Matisse is a Python tool that will find your iTunes album artwork files and convert them into human viewable JPEGs. iTunes naturally adds metadata and other necessary information to the album artwork you download and import so it can use it for Cover Flow and application-specific purposes. This can be bothersome since you can't view .itc files and especially if you want to retain the JPEG versions of them.

Matisse currently only runs on OS X and requires Python 2.0 or higher.

Usage
=====
To run, simply type at the Terminal:

`./Matisse.py`

And Matisse will find the latest downloaded versions of your iTunes album artwork for you. It will create a folder on your Desktop called **MatisseAlbumArtwork**, which will contain all of your iTunes album artwork in their respective JPEG formats.
