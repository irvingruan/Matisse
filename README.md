Named after the French artist and printmaker [Henri Matisse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Matisse), Matisse is a Python tool that will find your iTunes album artwork files, convert them from their unreadable format, and make your collection publish-ready through an elegant Cover Flow visual.

Matisse currently only runs on OS X and requires Python 2.0 or higher.

Usage
=====
To run, simply type at the Terminal:

`./Matisse.py`

And Matisse will find the latest downloaded versions of your iTunes album artwork, publish the HTML files and artwork to your Desktop, and load the collection on your web browser to see.

To see a sample of the generated effect, open the included `sample.html` in your browser.
